## Overview

This skill provides access to the **`CanvasOpsService.DeleteSelected`** RPC method on the Huaqiu EDA engine. It is part of the **canvas** domain and executes against the `canvasOps` client.

## How to Use

The skill is executed by the HQ EDA skill runtime, which provides a `SkillContext` with a connected `EditorClient`. The runtime calls `skill.execute(ctx, input)` where `input` must match the `CanvasContextRequestSchema` protobuf message shape.

```typescript
import { getSkill } from "@huaqiu/hqeda";

const skill = getSkill("canvas-delete-selected");
const result = await skill.execute(ctx, {
  context: {},
});
```
